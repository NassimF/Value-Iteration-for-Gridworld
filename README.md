## Problem description:



                   ******************
                   *   2    *    6  *
                   *        *  Win  *
            **********************************
            *   1   * ***** *   5   *   7    *
            *       * ***** *       * Lose   *
            **********************************
                    *    3  *    4  *
                    *       *       *
                    *****************
       
      
      
  * The agent will successfully  move in a desired direction with a chance of 70%
  
  * If the agent fails to move in a desired direction, it will move diagonally with a change of 30%

  * If the agent hits a wall, it will stay in its initial state


## Some explanation:

  *  The user will be prompted to enter the value of epsilon at first
  *  The value of gamma is 0.7
  *  The value of living reward is -0.2
  *  State 6 is the winning state and ends the game
  *  State 7 is the losing state and ends the game
